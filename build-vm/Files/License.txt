These license terms are an agreement between Microsoft Corporation (or based on where you live, one of its affiliates) and you. Please read them. They apply to the software named above, which includes the media on which you received it, if any. Printed-paper license terms, which may come with the software, may replace or modify any on-screen license terms. The terms also apply to any Microsoft
·	updates,
·	supplements,
·	Internet-based services, and
·	support services
for this software, unless other terms accompany those items. If so, those terms apply.
By using the software, you accept these terms. If you do not accept them, do not use the software. Instead, return it to the retailer for a refund or credit. If you cannot obtain a refund there, contact Microsoft or the Microsoft affiliate serving your country for information about Microsoft’s refund policies. See www.microsoft.com/worldwide. In the United States and Canada, call (800) MICROSOFT or see www.microsoft.com/info/nareturns.htm.
As described below, using the software also operates as your consent to the transmission of certain computer information during activation, validation and for Internet-based services.
If you comply with these license terms, you have the rights below for each license you acquire.
1.	OVERVIEW.
a.	Software. The software includes desktop operating system software. This software does not include Windows Live services. Windows Live is a service available from Microsoft under a separate agreement.
b.	License Model. The software is licensed on a per copy per computer basis. A computer is a physical hardware system with an internal storage device capable of running the software. A hardware partition or blade is considered to be a separate computer.
2.	INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.
a.	One Copy per Computer. You may install one copy of the software on one computer. That computer is the “licensed computer.”
b.	Licensed Computer. You may use the software on up to two processors on the licensed computer at one time. Unless otherwise provided in these license terms, you may not use the software on any other computer.
c.	Number of Users. Unless otherwise provided in these license terms, only one user may use the software at a time.
d.	Alternative Versions. The software may include more than one version, such as 32-bit and 64-bit. You may install and use only one version at one time.
3.	ADDITIONAL LICENSING REQUIREMENTS AND/OR USE RIGHTS.
a.	Multiplexing. Hardware or software you use to
·	pool connections, or
·	reduce the number of devices or users that directly access or use the software
(sometimes referred to as “multiplexing” or “pooling”), does not reduce the number of licenses you need.
b.	Font Components. While the software is running, you may use its fonts to display and print content. You may only
·	embed fonts in content as permitted by the embedding restrictions in the fonts; and
·	temporarily download them to a printer or other output device to print content.
c.	Icons, images and sounds. While the software is running, you may use but not share its icons, images, sounds, and media. The sample images, sounds and media provided with the software are for your non-commercial use only.
d.	Use with Virtualization Technologies. Instead of using the software directly on the licensed computer, you may install and use the software within only one virtual (or otherwise emulated) hardware system on the licensed computer. When used in a virtualized environment, content protected by digital rights management technology, BitLocker or any full volume disk drive encryption technology may not be as secure as protected content not in a virtualized environment. You should comply with all domestic and international laws that apply to such protected content.
e.	Storage. You may store one copy of the software on a storage device, such as a network server. You may use that copy to install the software on any other computer to which a license has been assigned.
f.	Device Connections. You may allow up to 20 other devices to access software installed on the licensed computer to use only File Services, Print Services, Internet Information Services and Internet Connection Sharing and Telephony Services.
g.	Remote Access Technologies. You may access and use the software installed on the licensed computer remotely from another device using remote access technologies as follows.



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MATLAB(R) Compiler Runtime (MCR) Version-7.10 License:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
·	Remote Desktop. The single primary user of the licensed computer may access a session from any other device using Remote Desktop or similar technologies. A “session” means the experience of interacting with the software, directly or indirectly, through any combination of input, output and display peripherals. Other users may access a session from any device using these technologies, if the remote device is separately licensed to run the software.
·	Other Access Technologies. You may use Remote Assistance or similar technologies to share an active session.
h.	Media Center Extender. You may have five Media Center Extender Sessions (or other software or devices which provide similar functionality for a similar purpose) running at the same time to display the software user interface or content on other displays or devices.
i.	Electronic Programming Guide. If the software includes access to an electronic programming guide service that displays customized television listings, a separate service agreement applies to the service. If you do not agree to the terms of the service agreement, you may continue to use the software, but you will not be able to use the electronic programming guide service. The service may contain advertising content and related data, which are received and stored by the software. The service is not available in all areas. Please consult the software information for instructions on accessing the service agreement.
j.	Related Media Information. If you request related media information as part of your playback experience, the data provided to you may not be in your local language. Some countries or regions have laws and regulations which may restrict or limit your ability to access certain types of content.
k.	Worldwide Use of the Media Center. Media Center is not designed for use in every country. For example, although the Media Center information may refer to certain features such as an electronic programming guide or provide information on how to configure a TV tuner, these features may not work in your area. Please refer to the Media Center information for a list of features that may not work in your area.
4.	MANDATORY ACTIVATION.
Activation associates the use of the software with a specific computer. During activation, the software will send information about the software and the computer to Microsoft. This information includes the version, language and product key of the software, the Internet protocol address of the computer, and information derived from the hardware configuration of the computer. For more information, see go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?Linkid=104609. By using the software, you consent to the transmission of this information. If properly licensed, you have the right to use the version of the software installed during the installation process up to the time permitted for activation. Unless the software is activated, you have no right to use the software after the time permitted for activation. This is to prevent its unlicensed use. You are not permitted to bypass or circumvent activation. If the computer is connected to the Internet, the software may automatically connect to Microsoft for activation. You can also activate the software manually by Internet or telephone. If you do so, Internet and telephone service charges may apply. Some changes to your computer components or the software may require you to reactivate the software. The software will remind you to activate it until you do.
5.	VALIDATION.
a.	Validation verifies that the software has been activated and is properly licensed. It also verifies that no unauthorized changes have been made to the validation, licensing, or activation functions of the software. Validation may also check for certain malicious or unauthorized software related to such unauthorized changes. A validation check confirming that you are properly licensed permits you to continue to use the software, certain features of the software or to obtain additional benefits. You are not permitted to circumvent validation. This is to prevent unlicensed use of the software. For more information, see go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?Linkid=104610.
b.	The software will from time to time perform a validation check of the software. The check may be initiated by the software or Microsoft. To enable the activation function and validation checks, the software may from time to time require updates or additional downloads of the validation, licensing or activation functions of the software. The updates or downloads are required for the proper functioning of the software and may be downloaded and installed without further notice to you. During or after a validation check, the software may send information about the software, the computer and the results of the validation check to Microsoft. This information includes, for example, the version and product key of the software, any unauthorized changes made to the validation, licensing or activation functions of the software, any related malicious or unauthorized software found and the Internet protocol address of the computer. Microsoft does not use the information to identify or contact you. By using the software, you consent to the transmission of this information. For more information about validation and what is sent during or after a validation check, see go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?Linkid=104611.
c.	If, after a validation check, the software is found to be counterfeit, improperly licensed, a non-genuine Windows product, or include unauthorized changes, the functionality and experience of using the software will be affected, for example:
Microsoft may
·	repair the software, remove, quarantine or disable any unauthorized changes that may interfere with the proper use of the software, including circumvention of the activation or validation functions of the software, or
·	check and remove malicious or unauthorized software known to be related to such unauthorized changes, or
·	provide notices that the software is improperly licensed or a non-genuine Windows product
and you may
·	receive reminders to obtain a properly licensed copy of the software, or
·	need to follow Microsoft’s instructions to be licensed to use the software and reactivate,
and you may not be able to
·	use or continue to use the software or some of the features of the software, or
·	obtain certain updates or upgrades from Microsoft
d.	You may only obtain updates or upgrades for the software from Microsoft or authorized sources. For more information on obtaining updates from authorized sources see go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?Linkid=104612.
6.	POTENTIALLY UNWANTED SOFTWARE. If turned on, Windows Defender will search your computer for “spyware,” “adware” and other potentially unwanted software. If it finds potentially unwanted software, the software will ask you if you want to ignore, disable (quarantine) or remove it. Any potentially unwanted software rated “high” or “severe,” will automatically be removed after scanning unless you change the default setting. Removing or disabling potentially unwanted software may result in
·	other software on your computer ceasing to work, or
·	your breaching a license to use other software on your computer.
By using this software, it is possible that you will also remove or disable software that is not potentially unwanted software.
7.	INTERNET-BASED SERVICES. Microsoft provides Internet-based services with the software. It may change or cancel them at any time.
a.	Consent for Internet-Based Services. The software features described below and in the Windows 7 Privacy Statement connect to Microsoft or service provider computer systems over the Internet. In some cases, you will not receive a separate notice when they connect. In some cases, you may switch off these features or not use them. For more information about these features, see the Windows 7 Privacy Statement at go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=104604. By using these features, you consent to the transmission of this information. Microsoft does not use the information to identify or contact you.
Computer Information. The following features use Internet protocols, which send to the appropriate systems computer information, such as your Internet protocol address, the type of operating system, browser and name and version of the software you are using, and the language code of the computer where you installed the software. Microsoft uses this information to make the Internet-based services available to you.
·	Plug and Play and Plug and Play Extensions. You may connect new hardware to your computer, either directly or over a network. Your computer may not have the drivers needed to communicate with that hardware. If so, the update feature of the software can obtain the correct driver from Microsoft and install it on your computer. An administrator can disable this update feature.
·	Windows Update. To enable the proper functioning of the Windows Update service in the software (if you use it), updates or downloads to the Windows Update service will be required from time to time and downloaded and installed without further notice to you.
·	Web Content Features. Features in the software can retrieve related content from Microsoft and provide it to you. Examples of these features are clip art, templates, online training, online assistance and Appshelp. You may choose not to use these web content features.
·	Digital Certificates. The software uses digital certificates. These digital certificates confirm the identity of Internet users sending X.509 standard encrypted information. They also can be used to digitally sign files and macros, to verify the integrity and origin of the file contents. The software retrieves certificates and updates certificate revocation lists over the Internet, when available.
·	Auto Root Update. The Auto Root Update feature updates the list of trusted certificate authorities. You can switch off the Auto Root Update feature.
·	Windows Media Digital Rights Management. Content owners use Windows Media digital rights management technology (WMDRM) to protect their intellectual property, including copyrights. This software and third party software use WMDRM to play and copy WMDRM-protected content. If the software fails to protect the content, content owners may ask Microsoft to revoke the software’s ability to use WMDRM to play or copy protected content. Revocation does not affect other content. When you download licenses for protected content, you agree that Microsoft may include a revocation list with the licenses. Content owners may require you to upgrade WMDRM to access their content. Microsoft software that includes WMDRM will ask for your consent prior to the upgrade. If you decline an upgrade, you will not be able to access content that requires the upgrade. You may switch off WMDRM features that access the Internet. When these features are off, you can still play content for which you have a valid license.
·	Windows Media Player. When you use Windows Media Player, it checks with Microsoft for
·	compatible online music services in your region; and
·	new versions of the player.
For more information, go to go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?Linkid=104605.
·	Malicious Software Removal. During setup, if you select “Get important updates for installation”, the software may check and remove certain malware from your computer. “Malware” is malicious software. If the software runs, it will remove the Malware listed and updated at www.support.microsoft.com/?kbid=890830. During a Malware check, a report will be sent to Microsoft with specific information about Malware detected, errors, and other information about your computer. This information is used to improve the software and other Microsoft products and services. No information included in these reports will be used to identify or contact you. You may disable the software’s reporting functionality by following the instructions found at www.support.microsoft.com/?kbid=890830. For more information, read the Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool privacy statement at go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=113995.
·	Network Awareness. This feature determines whether a system is connected to a network by either passive monitoring of network traffic or active DNS or HTTP queries. The query only transfers standard TCP/IP or DNS information for routing purposes. You can switch off the active query feature through a registry setting.
·	Windows Time Service. This service synchronizes with time.windows.com once a week to provide your computer with the correct time. You can turn this feature off or choose your preferred time source within the Date and Time Control Panel applet. The connection uses standard NTP protocol.
·	IPv6 Network Address Translation (NAT) Traversal service (Teredo). This feature helps existing home Internet gateway devices transition to IPv6. IPv6 is next generation Internet protocol. It helps enable end-to-end connectivity often needed by peer-to-peer applications. To do so, each time you start up the software the Teredo client service will attempt to locate a public Teredo Internet service. It does so by sending a query over the Internet. This query only transfers standard Domain Name Service information to determine if your computer is connected to the Internet and can locate a public Teredo service. If you
·	use an application that needs IPv6 connectivity or
·	configure your firewall to always enable IPv6 connectivity
by default standard Internet Protocol information will be sent to the Teredo service at Microsoft at regular intervals. No other information is sent to Microsoft. You can change this default to use non-Microsoft servers. You can also switch off this feature using a command line utility named “netsh”.
·	Accelerators. When you click on or move your mouse over an Accelerator in Internet Explorer, any of the following may be sent to the service provider:
·	the title and full web address or URL of the current webpage,
·	standard computer information, and
·	any content you have selected.
If you use an Accelerator provided by Microsoft, use of the information sent is subject to the Microsoft Online Privacy Statement. This statement is available at go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=31493. If you use an Accelerator provided by a third party, use of the information sent will be subject to the third party’s privacy practices.
·	Search Suggestions Service. In Internet Explorer, when you type a search query in the Instant Search box or type a question mark (?) before your search term in the Address bar, you will see search suggestions as you type (if supported by your search provider). Everything you type in the Instant Search box or in the Address bar when preceded by a question mark (?) is sent to your search provider as you type. Also, when you press Enter or click the Search button, the text in the Instant Search box or Address bar is sent to the search provider. If you use a Microsoft search provider, use of the information sent is subject to the Microsoft Online Privacy Statement. This statement is available at go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=31493. If you use a third-party search provider, use of the information sent will be subject to the third party’s privacy practices. You can turn search suggestions off at any time. To do so, use Manage Add-ons under the Tools button in Internet Explorer. For more information about the search suggestions service, see go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=128106.
·	Consent to Update Infrared Emitter/Receiver. The software may contain technology to ensure proper functioning of the infrared emitter/receiver device shipped with certain Media Center-based products. You agree that the software may update the firmware of this device.
·	Media Center Online Promotions. If you use Media Center features of the software to access Internet-based content or other Internet-based services, such services may obtain the following information from the software to enable you to receive, accept and use certain promotional offers:
·	certain computer information, such as your Internet protocol address, the type of operating system and browser you are using, and the name and version of the software you are using,

   subsequent releases of the Programs, if any, that are not charged for
   separately; exerting reasonable efforts to both (a) provide, within a
   reasonable time, workarounds for any material programming errors in the
   current release of the Programs that are directly attributable to
   MathWorks, and (b) correct such errors in the next available release,
   provided Licensee provides MathWorks with sufficient information to
   identify the errors.  During this same paid Software Maintenance Service
   term, Licensee shall also be entitled to receive technical support for
   the current release.  Technical support means assistance by telephone and
   electronic mail with the installation and/or use of the then- current
   release of the licensed Programs, including all available bug fixes and
   patches, and their interaction with supported hardware and operating
   systems ("Platforms").  MathWorks reserves the option to discontinue, in
   whole or in part, and at any time, offering Software Maintenance Service
   and/or technical support for any Program or Platform.

9. LICENSE DURATION ("TERM").  This Agreement shall continue until the
   earlier of (a) termination by MathWorks or Licensee as provided below, or
   (b) such time as there are no Programs being licensed to Licensee
   hereunder.  

  9.1. For Annual Licenses:  Licensee understands and agrees that each Annual
       License will expire automatically immediately after its corresponding
       one (1) year period, unless Licensee renews its License by remitting
       the then-current annual License fee.  Licensee understands that the
       Programs will stop operating unless Licensee pays the License fee and
       is provided new annual passcodes.   Licensee understands and agrees
       that the Software Maintenance Service for each Annual License will
       terminate automatically upon expiration of the Annual License Term. 
  
  9.2. For Term Licenses:  Licensee understands and agrees that each Term
       License will expire automatically immediately after the corresponding
       period of the term licensed, unless Licensee renews its License by
       remitting the then-current term License Fee.  Licensee understands that
       the Programs will stop operating unless Licensee pays the license fee
       and is provided new term passcodes.  Licensee understands and agrees
       that the Software Maintenance Service for each Term License will
       terminate automatically upon expiration of the License Term. 
  
  9.3. For Perpetual Licenses:  Licensee shall have the right to use the
       Programs indefinitely, subject to the termination provisions in this
       Agreement.  Licensee understands and agrees that the Software
       Maintenance Service for each Perpetual License will terminate
       automatically upon expiration of the initial Software Maintenance
       Service term included with the acquisition of the License.  Thereafter,
       the Software Maintenance Service term may be renewed for any Program,
       at the then-current price, and for the then-applicable term, as long as
       MathWorks offers such Software Maintenance Service for such Program.
  
  9.4. For Student Licenses:  See the Student Version Installation and Use
       Addendum for the License Term. 

10. TERMINATION.  MathWorks may terminate this Agreement and all Licenses
    granted hereunder by written notice to Licensee if Licensee breaches any
    material term of this License, including failure to pay any License fees
    due, and Licensee has not cured such breach within sixty (60) days of
    written notification.  MathWorks may immediately terminate upon notice
    this Agreement and all Licenses granted hereunder should Licensee breach
    the terms and conditions of Articles 3, 4, and/or 11.  Licensee may
    terminate this License at any time, for any reason.  Licensee shall not
    be entitled to any refund if this License is terminated, except for
    License fees paid for any Programs for which the Acceptance Period has
    not expired at the time of termination.  Upon termination, Licensee
    shall promptly return all but archival copies of the Programs in
    Licensee's possession or control, or promptly provide written
    certification of their destruction.

11. EXPORT CONTROL.  The Programs may be subject to U.S. export control laws
    or other (U.S. and non-U.S.) governmental export and import laws and
    regulations.  Notwithstanding any other term of this Agreement or Third
    Party agreement, Licensee's rights under this Agreement may not be
    exercised by Licensee or any Third Party in violation of such laws and
    regulations, nor may this Agreement be transferred to any party where
    doing so would result in such a violation.  The terms of any limitation
    on the use, transfer or re-export of the Programs imposed by MathWorks
    in any Destination Control Statement or other document for the purpose
    of export control shall prevail over any term in this Agreement.  It
    shall be Licensee's responsibility to comply with the latest United
    States or other governmental export and import regulations.

12. FEDERAL ACQUISITION.  This provision applies to all acquisitions of the
    Programs and Documentation by, for, or through the federal government of
    the United States.  By accepting delivery of the Programs or
    Documentation, the government hereby agrees that this software or
    documentation qualifies as commercial computer software or commercial
    computer software documentation as such terms are used or defined in FAR
    12.212, DFARS Part 227.72, and DFARS 252.227-7014.  Accordingly, the
    terms and conditions of this Agreement and only those rights specified
    in this Agreement, shall pertain to and govern the use, modification,
    reproduction, release, performance, display, and disclosure of the
    Programs and Documentation by the federal government (or other entity
    acquiring for or through the federal government) and shall supersede any
    conflicting contractual terms or conditions.  If this License fails to
    meet the government's needs or is inconsistent in any respect with
    federal procurement law, the government agrees to return the Programs
    and Documentation, unused, to MathWorks. 

13. FOR EUROPEAN UNION LICENSEES ONLY.  Any contractual provisions of this
    Agreement contrary to laws implemented under Article 6 of Appendix V of
    the European Union Software Directive or to the exceptions provided for
    in Article 5(2) and (3) of such Appendix shall be null and void solely
    to the extent decompiling, disassembling, or otherwise
    reverse-engineering of the Programs is necessary to enable the Licensee
    to create an independent program that is interoperable with the Programs
    or any other permitted objectives specified by such laws implemented
    under such directive (collectively, the "Permitted Objectives"),
    provided that any such information gained is used solely for such
    Permitted Objectives. 

14. TAXES, DUTIES, CUSTOMS.  Absent appropriate exemption certificates or
    other conclusive proof of tax exempt status, Licensee shall pay all
    applicable sales, use, excise, value-added, and other taxes, duties,
    levies, assessments, and governmental charges payable in connection with
    this Agreement or the Licenses granted hereunder, excluding taxes based
    on or measured by MathWorks' income, for which MathWorks shall be solely
    responsible. 

15. ASSIGNMENT.  Licensee may not assign or otherwise transfer this
    Agreement and its rights and obligations hereunder, in whole or in part,
    by operation of law or otherwise, without the written consent of
    MathWorks.  In the case of any permitted assignment or transfer of or
    under this Agreement, this Agreement or the relevant provisions shall be
    binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the successors, executors,
    heirs, representatives, administrators and assigns of the parties
    hereto.  MathWorks may charge Licensee an administrative fee for any
    permitted assignment.

16. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  The Programs should not be relied on as the
    sole basis to solve a problem or implement a design whose incorrect
    solution or implementation could result in injury to person or property.
    If a Program is employed in such a manner, it is at the Licensee's own
    risk and MathWorks and its Licensors explicitly disclaim all liability
    for such misuse to the extent allowed by law.  MathWorks' and MathWorks'
    Licensors' liability for death or personal injury resulting from
    negligence or for any other matter in relation to which liability by law
    cannot be excluded or limited shall not be excluded or limited.  Except
    as aforesaid, (a) any other liability of MathWorks and its Licensors
    (whether in relation to breach of contract, negligence or otherwise)
    shall not in total exceed the amount paid to MathWorks under this
    Agreement in the twelve month period preceding the claim in question,
    for the Program with respect to which the liability in question arises;
    and (b) MathWorks and its Licensors shall have no liability for any
    indirect or consequential loss (whether foreseeable or otherwise and
    including loss of profits, loss of business, loss of opportunity, and
    loss of use of any computer hardware or software).  Some states do not
    allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential
    damages, so the above exclusion or limitation may not apply to Licensee. 

17. LIMITED WARRANTY/LIMITATION OF REMEDIES.  MathWorks warrants that
    MathWorks, on its own behalf or through its Licensors, has the right to
    grant the License rights hereunder.  MathWorks warrants that the
    physical media provided shall be free from defects in material and
    workmanship for a period of ninety (90) days from delivery, or it will
    be replaced by MathWorks at no cost to Licensee.  MathWorks further
    warrants, for a period of one (1) year from delivery or for the term of
    the License, whichever is less, that each copy of each Program will
    conform in all material respects to the description of such Program's
    operation in the Documentation.  In the event that a Program does not
    operate as warranted, Licensee's exclusive remedy and MathWorks' sole
    liability under this warranty shall be the correction or workaround by
    MathWorks of major defects within a reasonable time.  Should such
    correction or workaround be impractical, MathWorks may, at its option,
    terminate the relevant License and refund the initial License fee paid
    to MathWorks for such Program.  All requests for warranty assistance
    should be directed to The MathWorks, Inc., 3 Apple Hill Drive, Natick,
    MA 01760-2098, U.S.A.

18. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES.  Except for warranties expressly set forth in
    Article 17 of this Agreement (or as implied by law where the law
    provides that the particular terms implied cannot be excluded by
    contract), any and all Programs, Documentation, and Software Maintenance
    Services are delivered "as is" and MathWorks makes and the Licensee
    receives no additional express or implied warranties.  MathWorks and its
    Licensors hereby expressly disclaim any and all other conditions,
    warranties, or other terms of any kind or nature concerning the
    Programs, Documentation, and Software Maintenance Services (including,
    without limitation, any with regard to infringement, merchantability,
    quality, accuracy, or fitness for a particular purpose or Licensee's
    purpose).  MathWorks also expressly disclaims any warranties that may be
    implied from usage of trade, course of dealing, or course of
    performance.  Except for the express warranties stated in Article 17 of
    this Agreement, the Programs, Documentation, and Software Maintenance
    Services are provided with all faults, and the entire risk of
    satisfactory quality, performance, accuracy, and effort is with
    Licensee.  MathWorks does not warrant that the Programs and
    Documentation will operate without interruption or be error free.  Some
    states and countries do not allow limitations on how long an implied
    warranty lasts, so the above limitation may not apply to Licensee.  The
    warranty in Article 17 gives Licensee specific legal rights and Licensee
    may also have other rights which vary from state to state and country to
    country.  Licensee accepts responsibility for its use of the Programs
    and the results obtained therefrom.

19. GOVERNING LAW; JURISDICTION.  This Agreement shall be interpreted,
    enforced and construed and the rights of the parties hereunder governed
    in all respects by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, United
    States of America, without regard to its conflicts of law provisions,
    and both parties consent to the jurisdiction of the federal and state
    courts located in said Commonwealth and consent to the service of
    process, pleadings and notices in connection with any and all actions
    initiated in such courts.  The parties agree that a final judgment in
    any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and binding and may be
    enforced in any other jurisdiction.  To the extent any governing law,
    treaty, or regulation is in conflict with this Agreement, the
    conflicting terms of this Agreement shall be superseded only to the
    extent necessary by such law, treaty, or regulation.  If any provision
    of this Agreement shall be otherwise unlawful, void, or otherwise
    unenforceable, that provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent
    permissible.  In either case, the remainder of this Agreement shall not

    other material term of this Agreement.  To confirm Licensee's compliance
    with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Licensee agrees to
    allow MathWorks to audit Licensee's use of the Programs, and to provide
    MathWorks access to Licensee's facilities and computers, and cooperation
    from Licensee's employees and consultants, as reasonably requested by
    MathWorks in order to perform such audit, all during normal business
    hours, and after reasonable prior notice from MathWorks.  If an audit
    discloses that Licensee has failed to comply with one or more Licenses,
    and such failure to comply could have in part or in whole been avoided
    by Licensee having paid additional License fees to expand the scope of
    the License or Licenses, then Licensee shall promptly pay MathWorks such
    Licensing fees (at MathWorks' then current rates) and, if such unpaid
    License fees exceed 5% of the License fees paid to MathWorks for the
    applicable Programs during the applicable period during which such
    underpayment occurred, then Licensee shall, in addition to paying the
    unpaid License fees, also reimburse MathWorks the full cost of such
    audit.

21. LICENSE MANAGEMENT.  The Programs contain technology for the prevention
    of unlicensed use.  The Programs require activation to exercise your
    rights under this Agreement.  You may also need to activate if you
    redesignate the Programs on your License or modify your hardware.

    Activation associates the use of the Programs with a specific Computer,
    and in some cases the Licensed User.  During activation, data about the
    Programs and the Computer will be transmitted to MathWorks.  This data
    includes the License information, Computer identification, and location.
    Some License Options may require the MathWorks Account information and
    the operating system user name for the Licensed User.  A License file
    will be provided to complete activation.  

22. HEADINGS.  The inclusion of headings is for convenience of reference
    only and shall not affect the construction or interpretation of this
    Agreement.

23. ENTIRE AGREEMENT.  This Agreement, and any applicable Addendum thereto
    including any documents referenced therein are incorporated herein by
    reference, and contain the entire understanding of the parties and may
    not be modified or amended except by written instrument, executed by
    authorized representatives of MathWorks and Licensee.  In the event of
    any conflict between this Agreement and any purchase order executed by
    Licensee (whether executed before or after this Agreement), this
    Agreement shall prevail.

THE MATHWORKS, INC. SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT - Deployment Addendum

This is an Addendum to The MathWorks, Inc. Software License Agreement (the
"Agreement"), and the terms and conditions of this Addendum are incorporated
therein.  Each capitalized term used herein and not defined herein shall
have the meaning ascribed to it in the Agreement. 

1. PURPOSE.  The MathWorks, Inc. Software License Agreement (the
   "Agreement") contains restrictions prohibiting Licensee from modifying,
   distributing, or providing access to the Programs or any Program
   Components (as defined below), except as expressly provided in this
   Addendum.  If the Programs licensed by Licensee under the Agreement
   contain Source Code or Object Code Program Components, then this Addendum
   sets forth the Licensee's rights with respect to creating Applications
   and Derivative Forms and distributing Applications, Derivative Forms, and
   Deployment Programs, as well as certain additional obligations related
   thereto.  

   MathWorks or its Licensors retain all right, title, and interest in its
   Programs, Program Components, and Derivative Forms of its Programs.

2. USER CREATED FILES.  This Addendum does not apply to M-files, MDL-files,
   MEX-files, MAT- files, VHDL-files, Verilog-files, FIG-files and P-files
   that are created by Licensee and that do not include any code obtained
   from M-files, MAT-files, P-code, MDL-files, C/C++ files, VHDL-files,
   Verilog-files, TLC-files, or other Source Code files supplied with the
   Programs ("User Files").  Licensee may distribute, sublicense, and resell
   without restriction, User Files.  

3. NONCOMPETITION.  Licensee agrees not to use the Programs, Derivative
   Forms, Generated Forms, or Program Components to make or distribute its
   own or a Third Party's Application, a principal purpose of which, as
   reasonably determined by MathWorks, is to perform the same or similar
   functions as Programs licensed by MathWorks or which replaces any
   component of the Programs.  Licensee shall not otherwise use the Programs
   to compete with the products or businesses of MathWorks, including by
   distributing Libraries, or any form of an entire Program or a substantial
   portion of a Program.  

4. DEFINITIONS.

  4.1. Application.  A software file that Licensee has created by either (a)
       using a MathWorks Program to compile or translate Licensee created
       Source Code or (b) incorporating or linking any part of any Source
       Code, library file, or other Program Component provided with the
       Program.  An Application must contain original code developed by
       Licensee and must provide substantial functionality not contained in,
       or provided by, the Program Components that are incorporated into
       such Application.  If a software file created by a Licensee
       incorporates Program Components, but does not meet the requirements
       of the previous sentence, then it is a Derivative Form (as defined
       below).  An Application may contain Linked Object Code which, if such
       Object Code was not Linked to the Application and was a standalone
       file, would otherwise have been deemed a Derivative Form. 

  4.2. Application License.  A license granted by Licensee to its end-users
       for the installation and use of Licensee's Application.

  4.3. Generated Forms.  The output of the MATLAB Compiler, Real-Time
       Workshop, Stateflow Coder, Simulink HDL Coder, Embedded Coders, and
       other MathWorks' code generation Programs in the form of Source Code,
       as well as such Source Code converted to Object Code or Linked forms.

  4.4. Derivative Forms.  A  software file that Licensee has derived from
       one or more Program Components (including without limitation by
       incorporating, translating, or modifying, in whole or in part, any
       Program Component), and which, if modified or copied without
       MathWorks' authorization, would constitute a copyright infringement
       or breach of the Agreement.  A software file created by Licensee
       which qualifies as an "Application" under the above definition shall
       not be deemed a Derivative Form.

  4.5. Linked.   An executable or loadable file created by a compiler or
       linker program combining Object Code module files.

  4.6. MAT-file.  The file format in which MATLAB stores data.
   
  4.7. MCR Libraries.  MATLAB Compiler Runtime support libraries and other
       files for deployment of Applications created with the MATLAB
       Compiler.

  4.8. Object Code.  The code created by a system compiler from source code;
       also called "machine- readable code".  Object Code can be Linked with
       an appropriate linker to resolve address references and may be
       combined with other Object Code for targeted execution on a specific
       processor.  Object Code includes "Object Code libraries" and "shared
       libraries," which are groupings of Object Code for specific purposes.

  4.9. Program Component.  Any portion of, or file provided with, a Program.
   
  4.10. Source Code.  Human-readable program code written in a higher-level
        language such as C, C++, Java, MATLAB, MDL, VHDL, Verilog, or
        Fortran, which must be translated or compiled into machine-readable
        language before it can be executed by a computer.  Source Code also
        includes header files and other human-readable files necessary for a
        Program to be compiled in the higher- level language.

  4.11. Standalone Application.  An Application created using programming
        languages and tools other than the Programs, which executes outside
        of the Programs.

  4.12. Deployment Program.  Any MathWorks Program that either (a) generates
        Object Code or Source Code in response to user input, or (b)
        contains executable functions or data accessed by an Application
        (such as a DLL file).

5. DEPLOYMENT PROGRAMS.  Licensed Users of MathWorks' Deployment Programs
   may automatically generate code from M-files, Simulink/Stateflow
   diagrams, and other representations, into Generated Forms.  Furthermore,
   Licensee may copy and deploy these Generated Forms for use outside of the
   Programs.

   Not all Programs are eligible for deployment within Licensee's
   Application.  For a list of Ineligible Programs see
   www.mathworks.com/ineligible_programs. 

  5.1. MATLAB Application Deployment Programs

    5.1.1. MATLAB Compiler. Licensee may use and distribute the MCR
           Libraries for the sole purpose of running Licensed User's
           Application generated by the MATLAB Compiler.  Licensee may
           deploy, at no cost, copies of such Applications that incorporate
           the MCR Libraries and compiled versions of M-files from the
           licensed Programs required for the Application.  No further fees
           shall be due to MathWorks for such deployment within such
           Applications, regardless of whether the Application is
           distributed solely for Licensee's Internal Operations or to Third
           Parties. 

           Licensee may make copies of the MCR Libraries accessible for
           deployment on an internal server provided such deployment is
           solely to its Licensed Users for use with an Application and for
           Licensee's Internal Operations only.  Licensee agrees to employ
           the same security measures to protect the MCR Libraries as it
           uses to safeguard Licensee's own proprietary intellectual
           property, but in no event  less than reasonable care.  No further
           fees shall be due to MathWorks for such server deployment.  

           Licensee is prohibited from making copies of the MCR Libraries
           accessible to any Third Party separate from a Licensed User's
           Application.  

      5.1.1.1. Licensed User may include, by compilation for deployment,
               only those select M-files from the licensed Programs required
               for the Application.  

      5.1.1.2. In no event shall Licensee distribute any library header
               files.

      5.1.1.3. Licensee's Application may not provide functionality or
               behavior similar to that of the MATLAB command line.  

      5.1.1.4. Licensee's Application may not allow operation of the code
               generation capabilities of Programs.

      5.1.1.5. Licensee's Application may not provide access to an entire
               Program or a substantial portion of a Program. 

      5.1.1.6. Licensee shall include the notice "MATLAB. (c) 1984 - [INSERT
               YEAR MATLAB VERSION PUBLISHED] The MathWorks, Inc." in the
               deployed Application's About Box, or similar visible
               location, and in the applicable documentation distributed
               with each copy of the Application.  

      5.1.1.7. Licensee must state in the documentation or other materials
               distributed with the Application that Licensee's limited
               rights to the deployment are governed by a certain license
               agreement between Licensee and MathWorks. Licensee may not
               modify or remove any license agreement file (MathWorks or
               Third-Party) that is included with the MCR Libraries ("MCR
               Library License").  Licensee shall insure that any licensee
               of the Application must first accept the terms of such MCR
               Library License prior to installation of the Application.

  5.2. Simulink Application Deployment Programs 

    5.2.1. Deployment Programs.  MathWorks provides directories of C, C++,
           Assembly, linker command files, template makefiles, project
           files, and TLC source code files with Programs that implement the
           real-time framework, code generation instructions, libraries, and
           Application Programming Interface (API) for use with the code
           generated by the Simulink family of products, including Real-Time
           Workshop, Stateflow Coder, Simulink HDL Coder, Embedded Coders
           and other Programs.  Licensee may use, copy, and modify these
           files in source code form for different development targets
           provided that they are only copied for development use in
           connection with Real-Time Workshop, Embedded Coders, Stateflow
           Coder, or other code generation Programs.

      5.2.1.1. Licensee may copy and deploy these files outside of the
               Programs in Linked Object Code form or Source Code form, if
               only used in combination with code generated by those
               Programs as part of a larger standalone Application. 

      5.2.1.2. No further fees shall be due to MathWorks for such deployment
               within Licensee's Application, regardless of whether the
               Application is deployed solely for Licensee's Internal
               Operations or to Third Parties.

    5.2.2. Real-Time Windows Target.  Licensee may not incorporate Real-Time
           Windows Target into an Application for deployment without
           contracting with MathWorks for an OEM or VAR agreement. 

    5.2.3. xPC Target.  Licensee may develop Applications that incorporate
           Linked-in copies of xPC Target and those files required for the
           Application that have been compiled or otherwise obtained from
           Real-Time Workshop and/or Stateflow Coder on a single development
           PC, and download that Application to a target PC directly
           connected to the development PC by either Ethernet or serial
           connections.  When running on xPC TargetBox, the Application may
           also be used for standalone operation, without connection to the
           development PC.  

      5.2.3.1 The right to distribute the Application beyond the target PC
              is contingent upon acquiring a License for the xPC Target
              Embedded Option.  No further fees shall be due to MathWorks
              for such deployment within Licensee's Application, regardless
              of whether the Application is deployed solely for Licensee's
              Internal Operations or to Third Parties. Additionally, the
              Embedded Option License allows for the deployment of API DLL's
              beyond the development PC.  No further fees shall be due to
              MathWorks for such deployment outside of an Application,
              regardless of whether the API DLL's are deployed solely for
              Licensee's Internal Operations or to Third Parties.  

6. OTHER SOURCE CODE AND SHARED OBJECT CODE LIBRARIES. 

  6.1. Programs may include selected Source Code and shared Object Code
       library files that implement various documented application
       programming interface capabilities of the Programs for which the
       Source Code or shared library file is part. 

    6.1.1. Licensed User may use and modify the selected Source Code files
           solely for creation of Licensee's own Applications. Licensee may
           copy and distribute Object Code compiled from this Source Code,
           but only as either standalone Object Code file (regardless
           whether a Derivative Form) or Object Code Linked to the
           Application, and only for use with and deployment of Licensee's
           own Application. 

    6.1.2. Licensee may use, copy and distribute shared Object Code library
           files (regardless whether a Derivative Form) for deployment of
           Licensee's own Application, but only if a header file exists in
           the Program for the shared library file. Licensee may not copy or
           distribute header files themselves.

    6.1.3. Licensee may not transfer Source Code, development rights, or
           development capabilities for any Source Code or Object Code to
           any Third Party.

  6.2. MAT-files.  Licensed User may create and distribute Applications that
       read MAT-files using the MAT-file API, however, if such Applications
       are distributed to Third Parties, they must also implement MAT-file
       write capability.

7. DERIVATIVE FORMS.  A Licensee shall only be permitted to distribute a
   Derivative Form to Third Parties (a) to the extent expressly permitted
   under Articles 5 or 6 of this Addendum, or (b) subject to the
   requirements of this Article 7.  A Licensee may only distribute a
   Derivative Form to a Third Party under this Article 7 if such Third Party
   is bound by a Software License Agreement with MathWorks that requires
   such Third Party to treat such Derivative Forms received from Licensee as
   such Third Party's own Derivative Form thereunder.  Licensee agrees that
   if such a Third Party provides Licensee with software that is a
   Derivative Form under the terms of such Third Party's Software License
   Agreement with MathWorks (or would otherwise be a Derivative Form under
   the terms of this Agreement), then Licensee shall treat such software as
   a Derivative Form hereunder as if Licensee has modified or generated the
   software itself.

8. WEB APPLICATIONS.  Only Programs licensed under the Network Concurrent
   User or Designated Computer Activation Types may be called from within a
   web Standalone Application, provided the web Standalone Application does
   not provide access to the MATLAB command line, or any of the licensed
   Programs with code generation capabilities.  In addition, Licensed Users
   may not provide access to an entire Program or a substantial portion of a
   Program.  Such operation of a Standalone Application via a web interface
   may be provided to an unlimited number of web browser clients, at no
   cost, for Licensee's own use for its Internal Operations, and for use by
   Third Parties. 

9. APPLICATION LICENSING.  For any distribution of Applications containing
   Object Code or Generated Forms to:

  9.1. Licensee's internal organization:  Licensee shall take appropriate
       action by instruction, agreement, or otherwise with any recipients of
       the Application, so as to enable Licensee to satisfy its obligations
       under the terms of this Addendum and the Agreement.

  9.2. Third Parties:  Your Application shall be accompanied by an
       Application License whose terms and conditions are at least as
       restrictive as the Agreement, unless the Application is part of an
       embedded system that has no provision for licensing to its end users. 

    9.2.1. The Application license for Third Parties must explicitly exclude
           MathWorks and its Licensors from all liability for damages or any
           obligation to provide remedial actions.

    9.2.2. In no circumstance shall Licensee include a warranty for any form
           of a Program that is inconsistent with or additional to the
           warranty contained in the Agreement.  

    9.2.3. The additional translation, use, and deployment rights granted in
           this Addendum are nontransferable without MathWorks' consent and
           shall not be conveyed in Licensee's Application license. 

    9.2.4. All copyright and proprietary notices for the Programs that
           appear in the original form delivered to Licensee shall be
           duplicated and included with Licensee's own copyright notices for
           the Application, wherever they appear.

    9.2.5. Licensee may not remove any copyright, trademark, logo,
           proprietary rights, disclaimer or warning notice included on or
           embedded in any part of the deployed Application.

  9.3. Notwithstanding the termination of the Agreement, all valid
       Application licenses shall remain and continue in full force and
       effect, and, if the Agreement was not terminated due to:  (a)
       Licensee's failure to pay the applicable fees to MathWorks, (b)
       Licensee's violation of the License restrictions, or (c) violation of
       MathWorks' proprietary rights in the Programs; then Licensee may
       continue to use the Programs to support Applications that have been
       placed in use pursuant to an Application License prior to the
       effective date of termination.

10. DISCLAIMER OF OBLIGATIONS AND LIABILITY.

  10.1. MathWorks shall have no support or warranty obligations, and
        disclaims all liability, for Applications developed or distributed
        by Licensee.

  10.2. Licensee agrees that prior to using, incorporating, or distributing
        the Programs in any Application, it will thoroughly test and
        validate the Application and the functionality of the Programs in
        that Application and be solely responsible for any problems or
        failures.

  10.3. Licensee will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless MathWorks and its
        Licensors, officers, directors, employees, agents and resellers from
        and against any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including
        reasonable fees of MathWorks' attorneys) arising out of any Third
        Party claim or demand based on or arising from, out of or in
        connection with (i) the creation, use, or distribution of any
        Applications or (ii) the use of the Programs by Licensee.

11. GENERAL.  Licensee acknowledges and agrees that a breach of the
