RaPiD: A Toolkit for Reliability Analysis of Non-deterministic Systems


/* This document showcases the steps to make the tool work on the VirtualBox using the .ova file */


/* This VM contains:
1. RaPiD binaries in the RaPiD executable folder on the folder.
2. License.txt file contains the license for Windows 7 Professional, Dreamspark, Matlab Compiler Runtime, Visual C++ 2005, .Net Framework 4
3. Installation.txt file has the steps to install the tool from scratch


*/


RaPiD.exe gets opened as soon as the VM is started.


Steps to run the 3 case studies specified in the paper:


-Go to Examples tab. 

-Select Reliability Analysis Examples.

-For First case study: 

Select "Call Cross System" and select any of the model. You would get the description of the model. click ok. You could see the model on the graphical editor on the right. To see the results specified for case study 1 in the paper for each model click on Distribution, Prediction and Sensitivity buttons. You can see both graphs and Report txt file generated.


-For Second case study:

Select "Therapy Control System". You would get the description of the model. click ok. You could see the model on the graphical editor on the right. To see the results specified for case study 2 in the paper for each model click on Distribution, Prediction and Sensitivity buttons. You can see both graphs and Report txt filegenerated.


-For Third case study:

Select "Ambient Assisted Living System" and select any of the model. You would get the description of the model. click ok. You could see the model on the graphical 
editor on the right. To see the results specified for case study 3 in the paper for each model click on Distribution, Prediction and Sensitivity buttons. You can see both graphs and Report txt file generated.



Note: When you click on Distribution button, a file dialog box pops out, click cancel to view both Graph and Report.
